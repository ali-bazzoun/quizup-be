## Project Features

- **Dynamic Models:** The system supports adding as many quizzes, options, and questions as needed, providing flexibility for future expansions.

- **Data Integrity:** When data is deleted, there is no residual or garbage data. For example, when a user is deleted, all associated scores and data related to that user are also removed.

- **Efficient Data Models:** Models are structured to include only necessary data, such as storing scores related to specific quizzes, ensuring a clean and organized database.

- **Observability:** The project integrates logging and metrics to ensure full observability of system behavior and performance, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
